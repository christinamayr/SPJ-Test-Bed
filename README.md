![Folders](/assets/images/ReadMe/Folders.png "Folders")
Your website is set up within these many different folders on this branch, each with their own purpose. 

If you are looking to make a change to your website, we recommend visiting the **_documentation** folder first. However, if you just want to better understand how the website works, here is an overview of what each folder includes: 

## :file_folder: _data 

This folder includes the navigation (menu), as well as another .yaml file (which is used for formatting). When you create a new top-level page, the navigation will have to be updated. This is a [document](LINK TO DOCUMENT) describing this process in the **_documentation** folder. 


## :file_folder:_documentation

This folder includes the documentation for making updates and changes to the website. Within this folder is a subfolder **_templates**, which provides page templates for your use. You will also find another [README.md file](LINK TO FILE) that details what processes are included in each document. 


## :file_folder: _includes

This folder holds the different “building blocks” of code that the website page layouts use. You shouldn’t need to make changes to these files. 


## :file_folder: _layouts

Related to _includes, these are the different page layouts available and should not need to be changed. To change a layout on a specific page, you will alter the front matter of a page file, which will be explained in [Tips-and-Tricks.md](https://github.com/christinamayr/SPJ-Test-Bed/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Tips-and-Tricks.md).


## :file_folder: _pages

Non-publication pages (as publications are technically considered “posts”) live within this folder.  As you add new pages, you will do so within this folder. Again, adding a new publication is a different process. 

Within **_documentation**, we have added a **templates** folder to make adding new content easy.


## :file_folder: _posts

This folder includes all of the publications. Publications are formatted as posts to include front matter such as the date of publication (which helps organize the publications on the front end). 

Within **_documentation > _templates**, there is a template for publication pages. This template includes comments for the front matter, where content should live on the page, and how to add content such as videos or images (as needed). There is also [documentation](ADD LINK) for adding new publications.


## :file_folder: _sass

This is where most of our website *theme* content lives. Like **_includes** and **_layouts**. Nothing should be changing here. 


## :file_folder: assets

This final folder holds all of the website assets. These assets include BibTex files, the website’s CSS, images, and publication PDFs and slides. If you are uploading images and other assets on a page, please add them to their respective folder (images, pdfs, etc.). You will then include them on the page using a [short link](https://github.com/christinamayr/SPJ-Test-Bed/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Tips-and-Tricks.md).
