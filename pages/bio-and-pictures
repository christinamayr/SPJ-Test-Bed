I’m a researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England. I started here in Sept 1998. I’m also an Honorary Professor of the Computing Science Department at Glasgow University, where I was a professor during 1990-1998.

I’m interested in the design, implementation, and application of lazy functional languages. In practical terms, that means I spend a most of my time on the design and implementation of the language Haskell. In particular, much of my work is focused around the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and its ramifications.

I am chair of Computing at School, the group at the epicentre of the reform of the national curriculum for Computing in England.  Computer science is now a foundational subject, alongside maths and natural science, that every child learns from primary school onwards (background here).

I am married to Dorothy, a priest in the Church of England. We have six children.
