<!-- a collection page is a page that culminates different articles within a folder and creates a link list. --> 

<!-- 1: to create a new collection page, create a new markdown file under _pages. In the markdown file, copy and paste the following metadata: -->

  ---
  title: TITLE HERE
  layout: collection
  permalink: /link-here/
  collection: GOES HERE
  ---

  <!-- You can also copy this template and remove all of these comments around the metadata. --> 

  <!-- To break down each piece of the metadata, anything within the two sets of '---' at the top of a page is considered page metadata.
  "Title:" refers to the title of your collection. Please title your collection appropriately and descriptively.
  "Layout:" refers to the type of layout on the page. This should always be followed with 'collection' for a collection page.
  "Permalink:" refers to the URL of your collection page. 
  "Collection" refers to the title of your collection. We recommend titleing this consistently with your 'title'. --> 
  
  <!-- Commit the markdown file. -->

<!-- 2: Create a collection folder. This folder should be created on the main branch for the website. We recommend titling the folder "_TITLEofCOLLECTION". -->

<!-- 3: After creating this new markdown file / page, as well as your collection folder, you will have to make some changes to your websites config file. These changes ensure your collection is populating with the correct content. --> 
  
  <!-- The config file is located under the main branch of the repository. Open the file, and click "edit." -->
  
  <!-- Within the config file, there is a section of #collections. -->
