<!-- A pubication page with a video is exactly as it sounds: it is a page, for a publication, in which there is also a related video for. --> 

<!-- 1: To create a simple page, create a new markdown file within the _pages folder. Make sure to include ".md" in the title to ensure the file is using the markdown format. -->

  <!-- In the markdown file, copy and paste the following metadata: -->

  ---
  title: "PUBLICATION TITLE"
  excerpt: "ONE SENTENCE EXCERPT"
  header:
    overlay_image: /assets/images/spj-stock-header.jpg 
    overlay_filter: 0.5
  permalink: /PERMALINK-HERE/
  ---
  
   <!-- You can also copy this template and remove all of these comments around the metadata. --> 

  <!-- ?: Add the page to the navigation. -->
