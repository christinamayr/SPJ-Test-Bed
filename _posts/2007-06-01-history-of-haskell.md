# Abstract
This long (55-page) paper describes the history of Haskell, including its genesis and principles, technical contributions, implementations and tools, and applications and impact.

You might also be interested in Simon’s POPL’03 talk: [A retrospective on Haskell](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/wearing-hair-shirt-retrospective-haskell-2003)

Watch below a video of the talk, the video starts a minute or so into the talk, but nothing important is missing.
