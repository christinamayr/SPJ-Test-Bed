# Hi there üëã

This is a copy from Sam Abbott's page that Christina shared with us. Sam is an infectious disease researcher interested in real-time analysis, forecasting, semi-mechanistic modelling, and open source tool development. Mally is using this text to try and understand how documentation could work as a README.md file. I'm using some formatting from [this link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Did I do it right?

## NOW
I'm a **cool** intern working on this github site. I want to try adding links 
>> This is how you make block quotes! *my "q" button is not working really well right now*

This is weird, but lists can be made like *my L button is also not working well right now* this:
1. first
1. second 
1. third

Or like this:
1. first
2. second
  - second and a half? 
  - second and something else?
4. third

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item

Huh. Guess you shouldn't use parathensis according to [this link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## What I'm Currently Working On
‚≠ê Figuring out if emoji's work!
‚ú® Do they? Also trying out `code`
‚öôÔ∏è do horizontal lines work?
