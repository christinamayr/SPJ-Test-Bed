# Hi Simon! Welcome to your website’s documentation folder.

This folder includes many different files to guide you through making changes to your website. Here is a description of the content each file includes:


## _templates

This folder contains the different page templates available. We created these templates to ensure consistency across the website. The following templates are available: 

- collection-page.md
-  pubs.md
- refined-page.md
- simple-page.md


## Author-profile.md

The author profile is located on the left hand side of many of the webpages. It includes an image, your name (Simon Peyton Jones), a title, location, and some links to social media profiles (as well as email and GitHub). This document details how to make changes to the different parts of your profile, such as changing an email or social link, or updating your image and title.


## New-pages-how-to.md

Website pages hold different forms of content. On your website, pages include content such as the Research talks and videos, as well as landing pages for posts, in the case of the Haskell page. While there are currently no plans to add new pages to the website, if there eventually becomes a need to add more content, here are some instructions on how to create a new page.


## Publication-how-to.md

Publication pages are the individual landing pages that include information about a publication, as well as the option to download the PDF of the publication or BibTex. This document provides information around how to add a new publication page (technically, post), or how to add content, such as a new video, to a publication page. 


## Research-skills-how-to.md

Research Skills pages include "How to Write a Great Research Talk," “How to Write a Great Grant Proposal,” and <add other page here.> These pages include a table of contents, and use either the simple or refined page template. This document describes how to add another one of these pages, including how to add it on the homepage of the website.


## Site-navigation.md

After adding a new page to the website, you will need to update the website’s navigation or menu bar. This document illustrates how to make these changes. 


## Updating-home-page.md

Your home or landing page is the first space people see when they come to your website. Currently, your homepage includes other pieces of content already mentioned (such as your author profile and Research Skills pages). This document details how to make changes to your homepage content, which is similar to making changes to other pages on your website.
